## 📌 Introduction
In this project, we will analyze house prices in **Melbourne, Australia**, to answer critical questions about the city's housing market. The goal is to provide insights into the current trends, such as which sectors are the most expensive, how house prices have evolved over the years, and whether certain months see more sales activity.

Additionally, we **predict house prices** using various machine learning models to provide an accurate forecast for future buyers and investors.

## 🔍 Key Questions
The analysis will focus on the following key areas:
- Which sectors are the **most expensive** in Melbourne?
- By how much have **prices increased** over the years?
- Is there a particular month where **houses are sold more** frequently?
- How are **interest rates** and **foreign investment** impacting housing prices?
- Can we **predict house prices** based on historical data?

## 🌐 The Economic Environment
The project also considers the broader **economic environment**, including:
- **Interest Rates**: With central banks gradually increasing interest rates to manage economic growth, how has this affected housing prices?
- **Global Confidence**: Since the recovery from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, global economic confidence has improved. However, the slow rise in interest rates is expected to have implications on real estate pricing.
- **Foreign Investment**: Foreign buyers can drive up housing prices, making it challenging for local residents to afford real estate. The project will explore how this dynamic impacts the Melbourne market.

## 💡 Predicting House Prices
To provide more actionable insights, we implement **machine learning models** to predict house prices, utilizing the following methods:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple but powerful model to predict prices based on historical trends.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method that accounts for multiple features to predict prices.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A sophisticated boosting algorithm to improve prediction accuracy over time.
